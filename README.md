OAuth2.0 - Episode 1
====================

Sir or madam,
Inside this archive, you'll find 2 things:

1) client-start - This is the start version of the code that we used to call
   the OAuth2.0 server.  If you've watched the episode, this should be the
   exact code we finished with for Hal's website.
   For more details on how to run the code, see the README.md file in that
   directory.

2) client-finish - This is the finished version of the code that we build
   in this screencast for Hal's website.
   For more details on how to run the code, see the README.md file in that
   directory.

3) server-start - This is the start version of the code that makes up the
   OAuth2.0 server called by Hal's website.  If you've watched the episode,
   this should be the exact code we finished with for Susan's website.
   For more details on how to run the code, see the README.md file in that
   directory.

4) server-finish - This is the finished version of the code that we build
   in this screencast for Susan's website.
   For more details on how to run the code, see the README.md file in that
   directory.

And as always, thanks so much for your support and letting us do what
we love!
